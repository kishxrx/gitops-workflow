# GitOps Workflow Project

This project is a demonstration of a standard Git and DevOps workflow, created as part of the Elevate Labs Internship.

## ðŸš€ About The Project

This repository contains a simple Flask web application. The primary goal is to practice version control best practices, including:
- Branching strategies (main, dev, feature)
- Using Pull Requests for code review and merging
- Documenting work with proper commit messages and tags

### The App

The `app.py` file runs a simple web server that displays a welcome message.

**Future Vision:** To evolve this into a "DevOps Daily Quote Engine".

## ‚ú® About The Project

This repository contains a simple Flask web application that has been fully containerized with Docker and is set up for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

The primary goals achieved in this project are:
-   **Version Control:** Professional Git branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, `feature`).
-   **Containerization:** A production-ready Docker setup using Gunicorn.
-   **Automation:** A CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub on every new release.

### üîÆ Future Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve this application into a **"DevOps Daily Quote Engine"** that displays a new, insightful quote about software development and operations on every page refresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

There are two ways to run this project: locally with Python or with Docker (recommended).

### Running with Docker

This is the easiest and most reliable way to run the application, as it works the same on any machine.

1.  **Ensure you have Docker installed.**
2.  **Pull the image from Docker Hub:**
    ```sh
    docker pull kingg123/gitops-workflow:latest
    ```
3.  **Run the container:**
    ```sh
    docker run -p 8080:8080 kingg123/gitops-workflow:latest
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

##  workflow Git & CI/CD Workflow

This project follows a modern DevOps workflow to ensure code quality and deployment reliability.

1.  **Branching:** All new work is done on `feature/*` branches, which are branched off `dev`.
2.  **Pull Requests:** Features are merged into `dev` via Pull Requests for review.
3.  **Staging:** The `dev` branch serves as a staging area for integrated features.
4.  **Release:** When ready for a new release, `dev` is merged into `main`.
5.  **Automation:** A new version tag (e.g., `v1.2`) is created on `main`. This tag push automatically triggers the **GitHub Action**.
6.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** The GitHub Action builds a new Docker image, tags it with the release version, and pushes it to Docker Hub, making it ready for deployment.

## üß† Project Learnings & Troubleshooting

A key part of this project was setting up and debugging the CI/CD pipeline. Here are some of the challenges faced and lessons learned:

-   **Production Server:** The initial Flask development server was upgraded to a production-grade WSGI server (**Gunicorn**) to ensure the Docker container was suitable for real-world use.
-   **GitHub Actions Workflow:** The workflow did not initially appear in the "Actions" tab. This led to a debugging process that involved:
    -   Verifying the file path (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`).
    -   Checking for syntax errors in the YAML file.
    -   Confirming that repository settings had Actions enabled.
-   **The Solution:** The issue was resolved by systematically simplifying the workflow file to identify a subtle syntax error related to a secret name (`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` vs. `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`). This highlighted the importance of meticulous syntax and configuration management in CI/CD pipelines.

This troubleshooting process was a valuable, real-world example of how to diagnose and solve issues in a DevOps environment.

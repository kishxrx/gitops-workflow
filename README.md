## ‚ú® About The Project

This repository contains a simple Flask web application. The primary goal is to practice and showcase a professional version control workflow, including:

-   **Branching Strategy:** Utilizing `main`, `dev`, and `feature` branches.
-   **Pull Requests:** Using PRs for code review and safe merging.
-   **Documentation:** Maintaining clear documentation with proper commit messages and version tags.

### üîÆ Future Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve this simple application into a modern frontend webpage

##  workflow Git Workflow

This project follows a standard Git branching model to ensure a clean and manageable codebase.

-   **`main`**: This branch contains the production-ready, stable code. All merges into `main` are done from the `dev` branch and result in a new version tag.
-   **`dev`**: This is the primary development branch. All completed feature branches are merged into `dev` for integration testing.
-   **`feature/*`**: All new features or bug fixes are developed on a dedicated `feature` branch (e.g., `feature/add-new-quote-source`). These are merged into `dev` upon completion.

**Future Vision:** To evolve this into a mordern aesthetic website
